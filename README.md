# Weather app

In this exercise we were to create a weather app that would let the user select a country and display a 5 days forecast as well as an image representing that country.

So far I have managed to fetch a list of country in an api,
display a picture representing a selected country from another api,
and display a fictive weather.

I would still like to actually fetch some data about the weather and also learn how I can hide an API key in a react app.
